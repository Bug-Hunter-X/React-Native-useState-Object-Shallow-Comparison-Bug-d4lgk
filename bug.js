This error occurs when using the useState hook in React Native with an object as the initial state.  If you attempt to modify the state directly, like `setState({...state, key: newValue})`, you will only trigger a re-render if the reference to the object changes. This means shallow comparisons are used, and React might not detect the change within the object itself. For example:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'John', age: 30 });

  const handleNameChange = (newName) => {
    setUser({ ...user, name: newName }); // This might not trigger a re-render
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Name: {user.name}</Text>
      <Button title="Change Name" onPress={() => handleNameChange('Jane')} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
